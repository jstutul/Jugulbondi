From the latest data from “Time”, the current rate of divorces is about 39%, which is huge according to the fact marriage is the most important occasion for a person. The main reason behind this is the reason for not getting a perfect match or even a proper match. Nowadays people are busy in their daily life. There is little time to find a person on their own.
